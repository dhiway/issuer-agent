/**
 * Helps to build a promise associated to a subscription callback through which updates can be pushed to the promise.
 * This promise is resolved with the value of the latest update when a resolution criterion is met.
 * It is rejected with a custom error/reason if a rejection criterion is met or on timeout (optional). Rejection takes precedent.
 *
 * @param terminationOptions .
 * @param terminationOptions.resolveOn Resolution criterion. A function that evaluates an incoming update from the subscription.
 * If it returns a truthy value, the promise is resolved with the value of the latest update.
 * @param terminationOptions.rejectOn Rejection criterion. A function that evaluates an incoming update from the subscription.
 * If it returns a truthy value, this value is used as rejection reason.
 * @param terminationOptions.timeout Timeout in ms. If set, the promise will reject if not resolved before the time is up.
 * @returns An object containing both a subscription callback
 * and a promise which resolves or rejects depending on the values pushed to the callback.
